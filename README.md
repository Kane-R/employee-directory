# React-Employee-Directory
Assignment 19 of my UWA Bootcamp React Employee Directory.

This assignment focused upon taking data from an API and processing it with filtering and sorting displaying it to the user. Instead of using pop drilling I decided to use reacts content providing state to components without using class components.

The user is able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category which is name.

  * Filter the users by at least one property which is also their name.
